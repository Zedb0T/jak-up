If you don't know what Only Up is, [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6A0uuxxaxQ&start=994).

This is still in alpha, only Hub 1 is completed so far. Ping me on discord (barg034) or create an issue here if you find any issues

## Known issues ##

- Lighting sucks and textures are fucked - yeah idk I'll fix it eventually (aka bug Kuitar even more than I already do)
- Some areas have too many triangles and overflow the collision cache, causing you to clip through stuff
  - Many of the lod0 NPCs can trigger this
